Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest Model with Python:
This repository contains code and resources for predicting wine quality using a Random Forest model. The model was trained on a dataset of red wine samples with 11 features. We evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics.

Dataset: 
The dataset used for this project is available in the file winequality-red.csv. It includes various attributes related to wine quality, such as acidity levels, alcohol content, and pH.

Model Training:
We employed the Random Forest algorithm to build our predictive model. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

Usage:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
Run the Jupyter Notebook file Wine Quality Prediction.ipynb to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Results
Our trained model achieved promising results in predicting wine quality. Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters or feature engineering techniques to further enhance its performance.

Acknowledgments
We thank the wine industry for providing the dataset and the open-source community for their valuable contributions.
